# [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/description/)

- Easy

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return _the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a
string_.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You
must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

<br><br>
**Example 1:** \
**Input:** `num1 = "11", num2 = "123"` \
**Output:** `"134"`

**Example 2:** \
**Input:** `num1 = "456", num2 = "77"` \
**Output:** `"533"`

**Example 3:** \
**Input:** `num1 = "0", num2 = "0"` \
**Output:** `"0"`

<br><br>
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.
- `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
